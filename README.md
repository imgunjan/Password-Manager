# Password Generator and Manager
This is a simple password generator and manager application built using Tkinter in Python. It allows you to generate strong passwords and save them along with the corresponding website and email/username.


## Features

Generates strong passwords with a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols.

Saves the generated password along with the website and email/username to a file.

Provides a user-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter.
## Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Tkinter library
## How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.

Install the Tkinter library if it is not already installed. You can install it using pip:

pip install tk

Save the code in a Python file (e.g., password_manager.py).

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

Run the script using the following command:
python password_manager.py

The password generator and manager application will open in a new window.
## Usage
Website: Enter the name of the website for which you want to generate and save a password.

Email/Username: Enter the corresponding email or username associated with the website.

Password: You can either generate a password by clicking the "Generate" button or enter a password manually.

Click the "Add" button to save the website, email/username, and password.

If any of the fields are left empty, a message box will appear asking you to fill in all the required fields.

After saving the password, it will be appended to a file called "data.txt" in the current directory.

Note: By default, the email/username field is pre-filled with "gunjanpokhrel7@gmail.com". You can change it to your own email or username or leave it as is
